                              RUM-Air is a multidisciplinary remote-controlled aircraft design team from the
                Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Collegiate chapter from University of Puerto
                Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM). The team is composed of approximately thirty five (35) collegiate
                members from diverse engineering disciplines, business administration and
                computer science. Each year, the team represents Puerto Rico in the SAE Aero Design
                East competition, organized by SAE International, against over seventy (70) university
                teams from around the World. The competition promotes innovation in the aerospace
                industry through challenging missions and design constraints inspired by current technology
                trends. The team’s goal is to design lightweight, efficient, and reliable aircraft
                capable of lifting the highest possible weight while meeting design specifications.

                  SAE UPRM is a multidisciplinary student organization
                dedicated to providing professional experiences for its members
                to allow them to put into practice what they have
                learned in class. Our collegiate chapter provides technical and
                professional development support to the most renowned special
                projects on campus (Aero Design, Mini Baja, Formula, and
                Solar Car), which allow over 70 students from various majors
                to design and manufacture different vehicles. We also ignite
                the imagination of young high school students with our STEM
                Initiative program through which we educate them in science,
                technology, engineering and mathematics and expose them
                to our special projects.

              <p>
                      Aircraft design, as with any other complex
                    system, involves a wide array of engineering, science,
                    and project management skills, making the
                    project inherently multidisciplinary in nature. To
                    cope with these technical requirements, RUM-Air is
                    composed of 35 college students from Mechanical
                    Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science,
                    and Accounting/Industrial Management majors.
                    In total there are around 45 students per semester including volunteers
                    that are not taking course but are pasionate about the project.

              <p>
                      Within the project there are students with different skill sets and knowledge levels.
                      From masters at manufacturing and aircraft performance to freshmen students who have
                      never been part of a project before and with limited skillset. We teach what we have learned
                      to others in order to keep the project going and with success as the goal.
                      One of the important aspects of Rum-Air is that it is one of the few project where the women are almost on par with the men
                      and more are joining the team every year. The leaders of the 
                      two different classes right now are both women capable of leading the 
                      team to victory once again. If you are willing and you are able, we welcome you to the team.

                    RUM-Air provides to its members
                    cutting-edge technical experience in diverse
                    engineering fields while boosting teamwork
                    and leadership skills to fully prepare them as
                    tomorrow’s leading professionals. This graph
                    shows the number of team members proficient
                    in select technical skills when they enter
